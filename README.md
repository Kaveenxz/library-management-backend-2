# Library Management Backend 📚💻

Welcome to the **Library Management Backend** – the heart and soul of your literary universe powered by Spring Boot. This backend system seamlessly integrates with the Angular frontend, creating a harmonious symphony for managing your library operations.

## 🌐 Getting Started

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/LibraryManagementBackend.git
   cd LibraryManagementBackend
   ```

2. **Run the Application:**
   ```bash
   ./mvnw spring-boot:run
   ```

   Your backend server will be up and running, providing the necessary support for your frontend.

## 🚀 Features

- **RESTful Endpoints:** Explore and interact with the library data through intuitive RESTful endpoints.

- **Data Persistence:** Leveraging the power of Spring Boot, your library data is securely stored and managed.

## 🧑‍💻 Development Magic

1. **Generate Entities:**
   Use Spring Boot CLI or your preferred IDE to generate entities representing your library's data model.

2. **Define Repositories:**
   Create repositories to handle database interactions effortlessly.

3. **Service Layer Magic:**
   Implement services to encapsulate business logic and keep your codebase organized.

## 📦 Building for Deployment

When you're ready to deploy your backend, create a deployable JAR file with the following command:

```bash
./mvnw clean package
```

## 🧪 Testing Grounds

Ensure the robustness of your backend using unit tests:

```bash
./mvnw test
```
